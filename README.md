## Introduction
God's EYE is a powerful Chrome Extension designed to detect and block phishing websites in real-time. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of URLs to accurately classify whether a given URL is malicious or benign. The extension works by sending the current URL of the user's active tab to a backend API, which processes the URL and returns a prediction. If the prediction indicates a high likelihood of the URL being a phishing site, the extension will block access to the site, protecting the user from potential threats.
